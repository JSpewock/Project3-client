[CockTails App](https://ga-project3-client.herokuapp.com/)

Our CockTails application was created to solve the problem of curious adults looking to craft the perfect drink but do not know all of the ingredients required. With this application, the user is able to search a third-party database [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) by drink name or ingredient (alcohol or mixer). In addition to this functionality, the user is also able to add to our database by creating their own drink.
